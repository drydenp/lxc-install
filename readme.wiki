== Personal LXC installation compendium ==

This page is comprised of 2-3 segments.

# [[wiki/repo.wiki|Explanation of this repo]]
# [[wiki/bare.wiki|Quick install instructions for installing LXC on Debian Jessie]]
# [[wiki/tuto.wiki|Tutorial on how to configure LXC for NAT]]

And then, the current file.

The repo serves two purposes:
* Automated installation script not only for initially installing the required firewall rules etc. (into /etc/network/interfaces mostly) but also to ''update'' the configuration after I've made central changes (in the script for it).
* Education people on how to do this.

The scripts are usable to anyone, but they will install into /root/fw (if you don't like that, fix it)
and not all options are configurable (so you'd have to change that) but they still provide an easy way
for anyone. To set this up easily.

But the explanation for how it works, is most important I think. I am meaning to get something like this of a tutorial on the Debian wiki.
